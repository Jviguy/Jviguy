## About me
I am a young software developer / engineer (Idk what to call myself as of now lmao...). I enjoy coding in Go, PHP, Rust, CXX, and Sometimes Java. <br > 
My interests are mainly in discord api usage and minecraft related projects. I like to help others code and a former support member at WitherHosting. <br >
I mainly use discord to show off my projects that I've used for learning or things that help others / solve a problem. Or I just believe are cool and deserve to be seen (Doesn't happen to often). <br>
